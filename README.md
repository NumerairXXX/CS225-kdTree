# CS225-kdTree
For photo mosaic function: dividing a picture into small pieces and find the closest thumbnail picture to replace that part

# When did this happen?
A very long time ago when I was in college and my coding style just... did not exist

# What is the nature of this project?
For UIUC data structure class, we use Linux environment and Vim to code (how to exit it's still running??? just joking, I figured that out)
We were mostly given minimal framework (luckily all the test code were given), and need to figure out the implementation on our own, structure codes in a way that it can be extended (even though we never did), write Makefiles, play with gdb. 

# What is the biggest takeaway?
why k-d tree is best for searching points in Euclidean spaces.
NNS algorithm
design template so it can work in any dimension
